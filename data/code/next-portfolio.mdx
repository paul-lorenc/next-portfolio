### [Next.js Portfolio Website](https://paul-lorenc.com)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [create-next-app](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

---

### Overview

The website features 4 main pages `/`, `/code`, `/images`, and `/links`:

- `/` - displays the 10 most recent [Slates](https://slate.host/lorenc) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) posts in order.
- `/code` - displays all of my code projects, with most recently updated posts first, which are held in mdx files under the hood.
- `/images` - displays all of my [Slates](https://slate.host/lorenc), with most recently updated slates first.
- `/links` - a static page displaying a small bio and links to my other webpages.

#### Dynamic Pages

The website also features two [dynamic routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes):

- `/code/[slug]` - displays the detailed content of the corresponding code project
- `/images/[slug]` - displays the contents of the corresponding Slate

### Content Management

This website was built because my first react website was hard coded, which made content management a pain. For this website, I add new code projects by writing up the post in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), and adding it to the `/data/code` directory, then pushing to the main branch which will automatically redeploy my app with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). As long as I correctly add the [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) to the post, I am able to parse it programatically using [next-mdx-advanced](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-enhanced) and add it to the website's feeds automatically.

For image hosting I use [Slate](slate.host). They give you access to simple REST API which allows you to get all of your slates, and get slates by ID, which is really all you need for a simple portfolio like I have made. Slate has been continuing to add support for more filetypes which could be useful in the future. To add new images I simply upload new files, then add them to existing slates or create a new slate and add them there.

### Styling

I styled this website using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### Running Locally

```bash
$ git clone https:github. com/ asdgag/ asdgh asd/h/asdfha/hafd/ha/dfh/adfh
$ cd next-portfolio
$ npm install
```

and then add your Slate API key:

create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add an environment variable called `SLATE_API_KEY=yourapikeyhere` in order for the site to build correctly. You can find a slate API key under the "API" section of the main Slate menu. After you complete this, run the website using:

```
npm run dev
```

### Deploy on Vercel

I deployed my Nextjs site using Vercel, this was relatively straightforward, I needed to add an environment variable using their interface and also needed to make my purge entry of my `tailwind.config.ts` account for `.ts` and `.tsx` files.

### Built Using

### Resources

I would not have been able to make this site without the help of extensive online resources surrounding these technologies, here are the resources I used to put together this site:

- [Nextjs MDX Blog](https://dev.to/jashnm/making-mdx-blog-with-next-js-part-1-1c0j)
- [Lee Robinson](leerob.io) - Reference Site [Github](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io) and also his numerous blog posts about the above technologies.
- [Next.js Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages)
